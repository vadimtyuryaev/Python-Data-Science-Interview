## Five Essential Concepts Explained Computationally

| # | Concept | Why It Matters |
|---|---------|----------------|
| 1 | **Central Limit Theorem**  | Justifies normal-based inference even for non-normal data. |
| 2 | **p-Value**  | Quantifies evidence against the null hypothesis. |
| 3 | **Type I (α), Type II (β) Errors & Power** | Specify reliability of statsitical tests.  |
| 4 | **Confusion Matrix** | Delivers actionable precision, recall, and F1 metrics. |
| 5 | **Cross-Validation** | Provides robust model evaluation. |
